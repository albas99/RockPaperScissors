# RockPaperScissors

A simple Rock Paper Scissors Game, see it in [action here](https://albas99.github.io/RockPaperScissors/)

There are 2 versions of the JavaScript code, the first version which runs in the terminal is saved in the file script.js and the second version with the UI functionality in index.js.

It's a bit of a messy code though, I didn't get to go through it and clean up everything but I tried my best to at least make it readable.
